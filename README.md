# ChristmasTreeLaneApp

Every year in early December Christmas Tree Lane lights up the Deodoras for the Holiday tree lighting Ceremony.  The ceremony is alot of family fun, but it's come to my attention that most of the attendees don't realize that the organization is run almost entirely through volunteers - and they need the community's help!  

This Ionic app will help to spread the word about all aspects of Christmas Tree Lane, including history, links to social media, event schedule, and what people can do to help.  Onward!!
